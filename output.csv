pick, there are varying levels of quality"
[1.24.5],"It’s clear that the slower bitrates aren’t going to give 
the  full  24-bit,  96  kHz  quality  that  LDAC  boasts  though,  so  keep  that  in  mind"
[1.24.6]," LDAC  is 
designed to provide superior sound quality by minimizing data compression and maintaining a 
higher level of audio fidelity during wireless transmission [Saha et al., 2023]"
